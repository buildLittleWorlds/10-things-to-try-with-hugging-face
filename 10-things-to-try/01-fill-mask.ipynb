    "## What is Masked Language Modeling?\n",
    "\n",
    "**In plain English**: Masked Language Modeling (MLM) is like a \"fill-in-the-blank\" test for AI. You give the model a sentence with a word hidden (masked), and it predicts what word should go there.\n",
    "\n",

    "You've probably done fill-in-the-blank exercises in school:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The cat sat on the ____.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Your brain uses context (\"cat\", \"sat\", \"on\", \"the\") to predict likely words: \"mat\", \"floor\", \"couch\", etc.\n",

    "### How BERT Was Trained\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) was trained on a massive corpus using this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Take a sentence**: \"The cat sat on the mat.\"\n",
    "2. **Randomly mask ~15% of tokens**: \"The cat [MASK] on the mat.\"\n",
    "3. **Train the model to predict the masked word**: Model learns that \"sat\" fits here\n",
    "4. **Repeat billions of times** across Wikipedia and books\n",

    "### Why \"Bidirectional\" Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Left context:  \"The cat\"     →  [MASK]  ←  \"on the mat\"  :Right context\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike older models that only read left-to-right (like GPT), BERT looks at words on **both sides** of the mask. This bidirectional context helps it make much better predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: In \"The bank was flooded after the [MASK] broke\", knowing \"flooded\" comes later helps predict \"dam\" (not \"robber\")."

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Masked Language Modeling** is a pre-training objective where models learn to predict hidden words based on context\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bidirectional context** (looking at words on both sides) is what makes BERT different from earlier models\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Confidence scores** tell you how certain the model is - but high confidence doesn't mean the prediction is factually correct\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Different models give different results** - model choice matters based on your use case\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **The pipeline hides complexity** - under the hood, it tokenizes text, runs inference, and processes outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "| Mistake | Why It's a Problem |\n",
    "|---------|-------------------|\n",
    "| Using wrong mask token | RoBERTa uses `<mask>`, BERT uses `[MASK]` |\n",
    "| Trusting high confidence blindly | Models can be confidently wrong |\n",
    "| Ignoring case sensitivity | Uncased models convert everything to lowercase |\n",
    "| Processing one sentence at a time | Batching is much more efficient |\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Notebook 2: Named Entity Recognition**, you'll learn:\n",
    "- How to extract people, organizations, and locations from text\n",
    "- The same BERT architecture used here, but for a different task\n",
    "- How models can label entire sequences, not just single positions\n",
    "\n",
    "The concepts you learned about tokenization, model inference, and confidence scores will directly apply!"
