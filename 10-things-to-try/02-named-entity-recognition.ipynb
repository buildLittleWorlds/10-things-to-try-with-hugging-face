    "\n",
    "**In plain English**: NER is the task of finding and categorizing \"important things\" in text - like people's names, company names, places, and dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical definition**: NER is a sequence labeling task where each token in a text is assigned a label indicating whether it's part of a named entity and what type of entity it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input:  \"Elon Musk founded SpaceX in California.\"\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Named Entity Recognition** extracts and categorizes real-world entities (people, organizations, locations) from text\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **BIO tagging** (Begin-Inside-Outside) is the scheme used to mark entity boundaries and handle multi-word entities\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Same BERT architecture** from Notebook 1, but with a different output head for token classification\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use `grouped_entities=True`** to get aggregated entities instead of raw BIO tags\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Confidence scores matter** - low confidence often indicates ambiguous or incorrect predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "| Mistake | Why It's a Problem |\n",
    "|---------|-------------------|\n",
    "| Forgetting `grouped_entities=True` | You get raw B-/I- tags instead of complete entities |\n",
    "| Not handling split entities | Multi-word entities may be incorrectly separated |\n",
    "| Using news-trained models on other domains | Medical/legal text needs specialized models |\n",
    "| Ignoring confidence scores | Low-confidence predictions are often wrong |\n",

    "In **Notebook 3: Question Answering**, you'll learn:\n",
    "- How to find answers within a given context (extractive QA)\n",
    "- How models predict start and end positions of answer spans\n",
    "- This builds on NER - both tasks extract spans from text!\n",
