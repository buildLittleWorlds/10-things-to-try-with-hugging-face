Read the plan file at ~/.claude/plans/vision-transformers-course.md to understand the vision course we're building. Also read the curriculum at ~/side-gigs/ai-ml-hugfac-experiments/10-things-to-try-vision/10_things_to_try_vision.md for context.

  Check the Progress Tracker in the plan file to see current status, then build the next 2 notebooks in sequence. Follow the Standard Notebook Template and Notebook-Specific Content sections for each notebook's structure and requirements.

  When finished with each session:
  1. Update the Progress Tracker in the plan file
  2. Update the Development Progress table in the curriculum file
  3. Add any notes about decisions made or issues encountered
